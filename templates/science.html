<ul>
	<li>Physics is a subject, with minimal content. However, to score well in the exams you will need a very deep understanding of the concepts in addition to how those concepts reflect in day to day life.</li>
	<li>The best resource for MYP Physics by far is the textbook provided by the IBO → <a href = "https://www.amazon.in/MYP-Physics-Concept-Based-Approach/dp/0198375557">https://www.amazon.in/MYP-Physics-Concept-Based-Approach/dp/0198375557</a>    OR     <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Physics-IB-MYP-Concept/dp/1471839338/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Myp+physics+textbook&qid=1588502579&s=books&sr=1-1">https://www.amazon.in/Physics-IB-MYP-Concept/dp/1471839338/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Myp+physics+textbook&qid=1588502579&s=books&sr=1-1</a></li>
	<li>There are four criteria in physics and they are --> 
		<ol>
			<li>Criterion A: Knowing and Understanding </li>
				<ul>
				<li>This is the criteria which has direct questions and tests the students on their factual knowledge</li>
				<li>These questions are usually associated with the command terms state, explain, describe, list, calculate, find, and other similar terms</li>
				<li>These questions range from 2 marks to 8 marks, depending on the command term used </li>
				</ul>
			<li>Criterion B: Inquiring and Designing</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This is the criteria which requries students to use their knowledge in physics to create investigations or lab procedures </li>
					<li>Students must mention the research question, aim, hypothesis, variables (independent, dependent and atleast 3 controlled variables), materials/equipment, procedure and a data table, in their answers. Based on the number of marks, command term used, and the bullet points provided, few of the above mentioned elements may be omitted.</li>
					<li>These questions range from 6 marks to 12 marks</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Criterion C: Processing and Evaluating </li>
				<ul>
					<li>This is the criteria where the student needs to derive conclusions from graphs, and/or evalute the validity of an experiment</li>
					<li>Questions pertaining to this criteria could either be to describe the general trend in a graph, or explain why a certain graphical trend is taking place. It could also require students to plot a graph based on the calculated or provided data points. Few questions would be linked to either a procedure they have developed (in a previous question) or one that is provided and they have to evalute the method, suggest improvements or extensions to the experiment, and comment on the validity of the hypothesis. </li>
				</ul>
			<li>Criterion D: Reflecting on the Impact of Science</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This is a lengthy criteria which requires students to do more typing and reading</li>
					<li>Questions in this criteria are usually based on a provided text. Students have to read the text and analyse the social, economical, environmental, political, moral, and ethical factors that are affected by the problem/solution in the text. This analysis must be done whilst using scientific terminology.</li>
					<li>The scientific terminology used is not only limited to physics. Terms from chemistry and biology can also be mentioned, as long they suffice the explaination for the above mentioned factors.</li>
				</ul>
			
		</ol>
	<p>The best way to prepare for all of these criterion would be to answer the questions provided in the MYP years 4 and 5 Physics textbook. The book has questions after each chapter, and the questions are a mix of all criteria. Answering those questions would be the best way to practice.</p>

	<br>
<p>As we can see from the graph, there is a straight line plotted, and this line passes through the origin. This means that the two values, current and voltage, are directly proportional. As we can see, when the voltage is 0v, the current is 0 A, when the voltage is 2v, the current is approximately 0.004 and this trend continues. However, after 9v, we can see that the straight line starts to plateau. This indicates that the filament will not allow any more current to pass through the bulb. This is because the limit of the filament would have been 9v, and will prevent current with a voltage of 9v or greater to flow through the bulb, in order to prevent damage (to the bulb).</p>

<div id="ans4" style="color: #FF0000; display: none;">
<br>
	<ul>
	<li>satellite internet access is more fast and reliable. It allows internet access on the basis of micro and radio waves which can travel long distances. Therefore, people can access internet without any human intervention and the signals will not be blocked by any objects. Moreover, satellites are long lasting when compared to cables. So, satellite based internet access allows people to use the same system for a longer time whilst cable based internet access requires constant replacement and repair of the wires due to wear-and-tear caused by weather, rats and other factors.</li>
	<li>for satellite internet access, satellite are launched from earth and established in a specific orbit. Launching the satellite from earth uses a lot of petrol and other non-renewable fuels, which when burnt produce large amount of carbon dioxide and other green house gases which contribute to the phenomenon of global warming</li>
	<li>a lot of advanced and expensive machinery is required and involved in the process of setting up a satellite based internet access system. First enough materials are requried to launch and set the satellite in space, and then strong and rigid micro or radio wave emittors are required. Similarly, strong and senssitive micro or radio wave detectors/recievers need to be established on earth. This might not be affordable for everyone and can cause reduction in global resources around the world. This reduction in global resources and technology around the world can alter global relations thus can lead to hostility and tensions</li>
	<li>satellite based internet access costs a lot more than cable based internet access due to the amount of set up and number of devices required to establish a clear receiver. More over, making and launching of satellites cost a lot of money, a lot more than setting up a cable based internet access. THis might not be affordable for everyone, thus forcing few epople to rely on a slow and inefficient form of internet access</li>
	<li>in conlcusion, I feel that cable based internet needs to be promoted and made much better, so internet access can become more affordable for people. however, satellite based internet access is the most reliable and efficient form of internet access that is there today.</li>

	<li type="none"><b>A.</b> The perfume contains complex mixtures of esters. The reaction of alcohol and carboxylic acid produces ester. This reaction is a reversible reaction and after a few days reaches equilibrium. Most reactions producing esters are exothermic. 
		<p>Equation: alcohol + carboxylic acid = ester + water</p>
<p> Using the above equation, explain why open bottles of perfumes are ideally stored in cold and dry conditions.</p> </li>
<br>

<button onclick="showans('chemans1', this)">Show Answer A</button>
<div id="chemans1" style="color: #FF0000; display: none;">
<p>By putting the perfume bottles in a cold and dry condition, the entire system (both reactants and products) are subjected to a strain or change. By putting the system in dry conditions, the amount of water is kept constant and there is no change. If there was a change in the amount of water, then the backward reaction will be favoured, the equilibrium would shift to the left, and would result in the products going back to form reactants. By putting the system in a cold condition, the amount of ester formed increases. This is because the forward reaction is an exothermic reaction and a reduction in temperature favours exothermic reaction. This causes the equilibrium to shift to the right, thus forming more ester.</p>

	The hypothesis for an experiment is given: <br>
	<p style='margin-bottom: 9px;'>If a saran wrap (plastic wrap) covers one of the beakers containing water and is put under the lamp, then the temperature of the water inside of the beaker that is covered by saran wrap will heat up faster then the other beaker containing water with no saran wrap covering it.</p>
	<p style='margin-bottom: 20px;'>This experiment, comparing the effect of the presence of saran wrap on the rise in temperature under a lamp was conducted, and the following was the data collected:</p>

	<br>
	<p style='margin-bottom: 9px;'>You would draw(plot) a graph such as the one shown below:</p>
	<img width='500px' src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/chemansc.png')}}"><br><br>
	<p style='margin-bottom: 9px;'>The key to the graph:</p>
	<ul>
		<li type='none'>Red points are --> Unovered beaker</li>	
		<li type='none'>Blue points are --> Covered beaker</li>
	</ul>	
	<strong style='color: #FF0000'><em><p style='margin-bottom: 9px;'>In the above graph, all the red points represent the uncovered beaker and the blue points represent the covered beaker. On the x-axis, it is time in minutes and on the y-axis it is the temperature of the beaker in oC.</p></em></strong>
	<p style='margin-bottom: 9px;'>As we can see from the graph, the covered beaker starts at 19oC, lower than the uncovered beaker which starts at 21oC. The uncovered beaker if we see, increases quicker than the covered beaker - at 5 minutes it was 23oC, at 10 minutes it was 24oC and so on. The covered beaker however increased slowly - at 5 minutes it was 20oC, at 10 minutes it was 22oC and so on. But from 25 minutes, both the beakers' temperature became the same. We can see that at 25 minutes both beakers were 27oC, at 30 minutes both beakers were 28oC. From 30 minutes till 40 minutes, the covered beaker remained at 40oC but the uncovered beaker at 30 minutes was 29oC and it dropped to 21oC during the 35 minutes and remained at 21oC till 40 minutes.</p>
	<p style='margin-bottom: 9px;'>The reason why this happened is that, the covered beaker, due to the saran wrap, the heat from the lamp is retained within the beaker and not allowed to escape. Since the heat that enters the beaker is not allowed to exit the beaker, there is more heat within the beaker thus causing the water to increase in temperature quickly and reaches a higher temperature than the uncovered beaker. The uncovered beaker had a regular heat regulation, wherein the heat that entered the beaker exited due to the open system because of which there was less heat that was retained thus causing the beaker to heat up slowly. This is what is known as the greenhouse effect in real life.</p>

<li type="none"><b>D. </b> Discuss how society can respond to climate change by altering human behaviour to reduce the carbon footprint. In your answer you should refer to both individuals and larger groups and include:
<li type='none'>
	<ul>
		<li>an outline of activities that increase the carbon footprint </li>
		<li>an explanation of how these activities increase the carbon footprint</li>
		<li>an outline of activities that would decrease the carbon footprint </li>

</li>
<button onclick="showans('chemans4', this)">Show Answer D</button>
<br>
<div id="chemans4" style="color: #FF0000; display: none;">
<p>Some of the most prevalent activities that increase the carbon footprint of an individual include transport through car, train & aeroplane and then consumption of meat dairy products in addition to the source of their food (where it comes from).</p>

<p>These three are the main factors that increase the carbon footprint of an individual. To begin travel by aeroplane is the most prolific emitter of carbon dioxide, as it takes a very large amount to fuel to be burnt, to provide enough energy for the aeroplane to fly thousands of kilometres, train travel is the second-worst emitter of carbon dioxide in transport, as it takes a lot of fossil fuel to be burnt for the train to have enough energy to travel hundreds of kilometres, lastly, car transport also emits greenhouses gasses like Nitrous Oxide and Carbon dioxide, and even though the amount emitted is less compared to train and aeroplane, the frequency of car travel is much more, making it just as significant.</p>

<p>Furthermore, food is the second biggest contributor to an individual’s carbon footprint, for example, meat and dairy product the most amount of methane (best greenhouse gas for capturing heat, so the worst for global warming) (almost 25% of all methane in the world is from cattle), this emission of methane comes from cattle grazing, flatulence of the cattle, the fossil fuel, water, and other resources used to produce food for the cattle, for example, Alfalfa, a genetically modified crop made for cattle, recently was blamed to be the sole factor for a lake being completely dried in the California, Texas region. Besides meat and dairy products, the source of where your food comes from is also a major contributor to your footprint, because if your food is not locally sourced then there are a large food miles (distance the food travels from its source, like a dairy farm, to your house) increases, which also emits a large amount of carbon dioxide, because transports like a car, train and sometimes aeroplane are used to transport food.</p>

<p>Some activities to decrease an individuals footprint would be a decrease or elimination of consumption of dairy products because as mentioned before, it releases a large amount of methane which is the worst greenhouse gas as it captures the most heat. Another activity to decrease the carbon footprint would be to travel by walk or bicycle as it releases no greenhouse gas. Another would be to buy food, that is only locally sourced, as the food miles will be far lower than if it was exported from other states or even countries (so less carbon dioxide emission, thus lower carbon footprint). Another activity to decrease carbon footprint would be to plant trees, because technically if you were to plant trees, the tree you planted would be absorbing some of the carbon dioxides.</p>

	<h2 style="text-align: center;">BIOLOGY</h2>
	<h3 id="intro_bio">INTRODUCTION</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Biology is an extremely content heavy subject, and requires the master of all core concepts, if you wish to acheive the best grades.</li>
		<li>The best resource for MYP Biology by far is the textbook provided by the IBO → <a href = "https://www.amazon.in/MYP-Biology-Concept-Approach-Student/dp/0198369999">https://www.amazon.in/MYP-Biology-Concept-Approach-Student/dp/0198369999</a>
		<li>There are four criteria in biology and they are --> 
			<ol>
				<li>Criterion A: Knowing and Understanding </li>
					<ul>
					<li>This is the criteria which has direct questions and tests the students on their factual knowledge</li>
					<li>These questions are usually associated with the command terms state, explain, describe, list, calculate, find, and other similar terms</li>
					<li>These questions range from 2 marks to 8 marks, depending on the command term used </li>
					</ul>
				<li>Criterion B: Inquiring and Designing</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This is the criteria which requries students to use their knowledge in physics to create investigations or lab procedures </li>
						<li>Students must mention the research question, aim, hypothesis, variables (independent, dependent and atleast 3 controlled variables), materials/equipment, procedure and a data table, in their answers. Based on the number of marks, command term used, and the bullet points provided, few of the above mentioned elements may be omitted.</li>
						<li>These questions range from 6 marks to 12 marks</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Criterion C: Processing and Evaluating </li>
					<ul>
						<li>This is the criteria where the student needs to derive conclusions from graphs, and/or evalute the validity of an experiment</li>
						<li>Questions pertaining to this criteria could either be to describe the general trend in a graph, or explain why a certain graphical trend is taking place. It could also require students to plot a graph based on the calculated or provided data points. Few questions would be linked to either a procedure they have developed (in a previous question) or one that is provided and they have to evalute the method, suggest improvements or extensions to the experiment, and comment on the validity of the hypothesis. </li>
					</ul>
				<li>Criterion D: Reflecting on the Impact of Science</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This is a lengthy criteria which requires students to do more typing and reading</li>
						<li>Questions in this criteria are usually based on a provided text. Students have to read the text and analyse the social, economical, environmental, political, moral, and ethical factors that are affected by the problem/solution in the text. This analysis must be done whilst using scientific terminology.</li>
						<li>The scientific terminology used is not only limited to physics. Terms from chemistry and biology can also be mentioned, as long they suffice the explaination for the above mentioned factors.</li>
					</ul>
				
			</ol>
		<p>The best way to prepare for all of these criterion would be to answer the questions provided in the MYP years 4 and 5 Biology textbook. The book has questions after each chapter, and the questions are a mix of all criteria. Answering those questions would be the best way to practice.</p>

		<p style='margin-bottom: 9px;'>These are the most important pollinators of our fruits, vegetables, flowers and crops, more than 1/3 of the world’s population depends on pollination by bees.</p>
		<p style='margin-bottom: 9px;'>In 2006 entire colonies were reported to be dying worldwide.
		Modern industrialization of farming has changed how farmers operate their farms, farmers have stopped planting crops such as clover and alfalfa which are natural fertilisers that fix nitrogen in the soil. Clover and alfalfa or also highly nutritious food for bees.
		Farmers now use synthetic fertilizers to fix nitrogen in the soil. Herbicides are used to kill the weeds in farms. Many of these weeds are flowering plants that bees need for their survival.
		Farmers are increasing their profits by changing to monoculture farming.
		Monoculture is when farms grow single crops on a large scale, monoculture farming results in pollen only being available during a short time when the crop is flowering. In a natural environment there would be a series of plants flowering at different times, monoculture farming has also resulted in increased use of pesticides.</p>
		<p style='margin-bottom: 35px;'>Recent research has found that there are at least 6 different pesticides in every batch of pollen collected by a honey bee.
		In some areas of the world, bees are now so rare that crops have to be pollinated by hand with feathers.
		Bees are dying from these multiple and interacting causes. This is leading to a problem called colony collapse disorder. Bee colony collapse disorder now joins global warming, forest destruction and species extinction as our most urgent ecological emergencies.
		Beekeepers, farmers, politicians and conservationists are working together to identify solutions such as banning pesticides, returning to ecological multi crop farming and preserving wild habitats for bees.
		These solutions help to preserve biological diversity, this is an example of how humankind can make decisions that positively impact the global environment.</p></em>

As a result of this, the ground water system is polluted and made extremely toxic, thus killing many marine organisms thus disrupting the marine ecosystem. Moreover, by reducing the usage of natural fertilisers, organisms which rely on them for food and survival will be affected and would be driven to death - for instance the bees.</td>

			<p style='margin-bottom: 9px;'>MIFT uses large scale machinery which rely on electricity for their working. As a result of this, there is a lot more coal that is burnt for producing electricity, leading to the emission of lots of carbon dioxide and monoxide, which are harmful green house gases that lead to global warming and other environmental impacts such as ocean acidification.</p>
			<p style='margin-bottom: 9px;'>MIFT uses expensive chemicals and machinery to increase the efficiency of their production methods, thus increasing the yields of the crops. Using such expensive equipment means there is an increase in the production costs. Companies, in order to increase their profits, sell the crops at a higher price. This might not be affordable for everyone in the market. Due to this, there would be a few people who cannot buy the crops and are forced to starve to death. On top of that, in order to fund these machines and production techniques, government raises taxes and the prices of general goods, thus forcing people to pay more. This might not be affordable for many.</p>
			<p>In conclusion, I believe MIFT are very successful methods for mass producing crops quickly, however are extremely harmful to the health of consumers and the environment, thus making it unsustainable and unsuccessful.</p>
